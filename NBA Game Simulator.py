#Step 1. Correctly use readfile Function and import data
#Step 2. Initialilze nested dictionary
#Step 3. Create mean function to determine average ppg per team
#Step 4. Create standard deviation function
#Step 5. Given mean and standard deviation function, create game simulator
#Step 6. Create option to allow user to run the simulation
#Step 7. Create option where user can select teams
#Step 8. Create option where user can have random function select 2 teams for them
#Step 9. Prompt user to choose select teams or have random function select for them
#Step 10. Calculate accuracy user guessed with
